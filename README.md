# Welcome

Hi, I’m Patrice, career changer from Maths Teacher to Data Science.

## My Background
- I’m currently enrolled on a HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, and __most__ of the repositories on this page are from the bootcamp.
- I am _also_ learning SQL and will be adding those projects over time.

## Languages
Current languages are Python and SQL, with plans in place to learn more as time progresses.
